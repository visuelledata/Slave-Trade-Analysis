This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
slave_db <- haven::read_sav("Data/tastdb-exp-2016.sav")

slave_db <- slave_db %>% 
  convert_to_NA('NaN') %>% 
  remove_empty_cols() #removes adult4 (adults embarked at second point of purchase)
  
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
slave_db %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = guns, y = tonnage)) + 
    geom_jitter() + 
    facet_wrap(~national)


slave_db %>% 
  ggplot(aes(slintend, tslavesd)) + 
  geom_point()


slave_db %>% 
  ggplot(aes(sladamer, sladvoy)) + 
  geom_jitter()


slave_db %>% 
  group_by(resistance) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  arrange(desc(n)) %>% 
  head(n = 10) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(resistance), y = n)) + 
  geom_col()



```
